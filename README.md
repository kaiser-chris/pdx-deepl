# Overview
**pdx-deepl** is a tool to do incremental auto translation of mods for Paradox games using DeepL.

## Status
[![Build Binaries](https://github.com/kaiser-chris/pdx-deepl/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kaiser-chris/pdx-deepl/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

## How does it work?
The tool will use a base language and check whether a localization key
from the base language is either missing or outdated in other languages.
If a key is missing or outdated, it will translate the base language localization
and add the translation to the same file for another language.
Also, the translation is marked with a checksum of the base language key so that in
a second run pdx-deepl can check whether a key was updated.

## Manual and Machine translation
Localizations that are generated by pdx-deepl will have a comment like this at the end:
```yaml
 je_obj_magic_academy: "Magische Akademie bauen" #deepl:3993713733
```
This marks them as machine translated and pdx-deepl will update them when necessary.

All localizations without this comment at the end will be treated as manually translated
and are not touched by pdx-deepl.

In this example the localization `objective_magic_dominance_idle_header` is assumed to be
manually translated and will therefore be ignored by pdx-deepl.
```yaml
 je_obj_magic_academy: "Magische Akademie bauen" #deepl:3993713733
 objective_magic_dominance_idle_header: "Setzen Sie Ihren Weg fort"
```

The system allows translators to touch up specific localizations which are
then preserved in further handling.

## Supported Games
- Victoria 3
- Crusader Kings 3
- Others may work but are untested

## Configuration
pdx-deepl translation can be configured with the [translation-config.json](translation-config.json).
In this file, you can define which language should be used as a base for translations and also
which languages should be generated.

In this example the `english` localization will be treated as the source of truth and pdx-deepl
will generate translations for `german` and `french`.
```json
{
  "base-language": "english",
  "target-languages": [
    "german",
    "french"
  ]
}
```
